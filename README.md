If, like me, you accidentally deleted the scheduled tasks in the "softwareprotectionplatform" folder and you get the following errors, 
you can solve the problem by importing these XML files.


When I go to Event Properties for the Security-SPP error I'm getting the following information is presented:

"Failed to schedule Software Protection service for re-start at 2115-10-20T14:37:48Z. Error Code: 0x80070002."
